A Windows 11 (24H2) rootkit written in Rust to implement Kernel Mode ETW bypasses. 

This project is not designed to be a complete rootkit, just showcasing the elements related to ETW evasion and bypasses. This is done to complement my EDR, [Sanctum](https://github.com/0xflux/Sanctum), for which
I am doing my own research to monitor and detect attempts to bypass the ETW mechanism in the kernel via a rootkit (or other methods
of kernel mode execution).
